# MyShell

Implementation of the Linux Shell - Bash - written in C.

Includes added functionality such as:

    -> History tracker - keeps a list of the most recent 20 commands across sessions
       (does not check for validity)
    -> Supports file I/O redirection
    -> Supports wildcard expansion
    -> shows absolute path to executable program prior to running command

To test:

    -> clone into repository
    -> run "make" (If not installed , run "sudo apt-get install make")
