# MyShell

Implementation of the Linux Shell - Bash - written in C.

Includes added functionality such as:

    -> History tracker - keeps a list of the most recent 20 commands
       (does not check for validity)
    -> Supports file I/O redirection
    -> Supports wildcard expansion
    -> shows absolute path to executable program prior to running command

To test, run "make" and then the executable.
